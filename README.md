# Youtube-Downloader
Huzzah! Here's a simple electron app for downloading youtube videos as mp3's and performing bulk edits on mp3 metadata.

It's served me well so far. Cat Empire, The Happy Fits, and Vampire Weekend now get to be a little bit closer to my heart.

## Instructions
* Download repo
* Have node js installed and npm installed
* run `npm install` in the main folder
* run `npm start` to launch
* stop complaining that it's not packaged into a native app. Give it time
